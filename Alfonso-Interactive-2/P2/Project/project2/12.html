<div class= "move_my_body"><h1>NO TIME TO FEEL</h1></div>

<div class= "go_right">

The way that I've arranged my life,

I've left no time to feel.

This anesthetic works so well

I never do reveal

my feelings even to myself

or to those close to me.

By keeping busy all the time

I act like I am free,

and if I have some time to spare

I fill it up real fast,

and pray this numbing sedative

is somehow going to last.

When nosey people question me

I hasten to explain

this is my plan to get through life

by minimizing pain,

and yet at times I lie awake

obsessed by sudden doubt&ndash;

I worry that I'm just a fool

and somehow missing out.

I do not hope to really live

but merely to survive,

but will I mourn when I'm near death

not having been alive?
