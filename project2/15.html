<em>The way that I've arranged my life,<br>

I've left no time to feel.<br>

This anesthetic works so well<br>

I never do reveal<br>

my feelings even to myself<br>

or to those close to me.<br>

By keeping busy all the time<br>

I act like I am free,<br>

and if I have some time to spare<br>

I fill it up real fast,<br>

and pray this numbing sedative<br>

is somehow going to last.<br>

When nosey people question me</em><br>

<div class= "title"><h1>NO TIME TO FEEL <em>Tom Greening</em></h1></div>

<em>I hasten to explain<br>

this is my plan to get through life<br>

by minimizing pain,<br>

and yet at times I lie awake<br>

obsessed by sudden doubt&ndash;<br>

I worry that I'm just a fool<br>

and somehow missing out.<br>

I do not hope to really live<br>

but merely to survive,<br>

but will I mourn when I'm near death<br>

not having been alive?</em><br>
