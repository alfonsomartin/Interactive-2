<div class="top">NO TIME TO FEEL</div>


<div class="container">
	<strong>Tom Greening</strong><br>

	<p>The way that I've arranged my life,<br>

	I've left no time to feel.<br>

	This anesthetic works so well<br>

	I never do reveal<br>

	my feelings even to myself<br>

	or to those close to me.<br>

	By keeping busy all the time<br>

	I act like I am free,<br>

	and if I have some time to spare<br>

	I fill it up real fast,<br>

	and pray this numbing sedative<br>

	is somehow going to last.<br>

	When nosey people question me<br>

	I hasten to explain<br>

	this is my plan to get through life<br>

	by minimizing pain,<br>

	and yet at times I lie awake<br>

	obsessed by sudden doubt&ndash;<br>

	I worry that I'm just a fool<br>

	and somehow missing out.<br>

	I do not hope to really live<br>

	but merely to survive,<br>

	but will I mourn when I'm near death<br>

	not having been alive?<br></p>
